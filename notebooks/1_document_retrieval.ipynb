    "In this tutorial, we will be using `council` to build a document retrieval agent that can answer questions about Microsoft's 2022 10-K report, a comprehensive report filed annually by publicly-traded companies about their financial performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many real-world scenarios, LLMs might not have enough contextual information to answer certain types of queries. For instance, if a query pertains to very recent or rapidly changing data (like today's weather or latest stock prices), it falls outside the scope of a pre-trained LLM, which has been trained on a fixed, static corpus of text and does not inherently know about events in the world after its training data was collected. This applies to OpenAI's gpt-4 and gpt-3.5 models that have a knowledge cutoff date of September 2021 and would not be able to answer questions using information found in Microsoft's 2022 documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where augmenting an LLM with external data can be beneficial. By adding up-to-date information fetched from external data sources to the LLM prompt as context, we can make the responses from the LLM more relevant and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we augment an LLM with external data, it can be beneficial to represent this external data in a way that allows for efficient search and retrieval. One common approach is to convert the data into a series of vectors, and store these in a vector index. A vector index is a data structure used to optimize the lookup of vectors in high-dimensional spaces. The vector representation allows us to perform similarity searches: given a query vector, we can find the most similar vectors in the index, which correspond to the most relevant pieces of data. This can significantly speed up data retrieval and make the augmentation process more efficient, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using `LLamaIndex`, a framework for augmenting LLMs with external data, for creating a vector index.\n",

    "- LlamaIndex [documentation](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The process will include the following steps:\n",
    "1) Extracting the text from Microsoft's 10-K saved as a pdf\n",
    "2) Splitting the text into chunks of a certain size\n",
    "3) Creating embeddings for each text chunk\n",
    "4) Storing the text chunks and their corresponding embeddings in a vector index\n",
    "5) Retrieving text chunks most similar to a user query based on semantic similarity\n",
